RapidoFSM
=========

Rapido! is a finite state machine (FSM) graphical editor. It allows you to design your FSMs easily and generates all the boring code for you. Originally developped as part of [the Rush](http://sourceforge.net/projects/therush/), a video game project, it can be used in a lot of other situations.

Rapido! is under the GPL license. It uses wxWidgets for the user interface, making it portable and cross-platform.
